Project Summary: Sign Language Letter Detection with Quantum Neural Network Denoiser

Overview:
This project is a sign language letter detection and recognition system that combines classical deep learning and quantum machine learning techniques to improve detection accuracy, especially in noisy environments.

Architecture and Components:

1. Data:
- The dataset consists of paired noisy and clean images organized in labeled folders.
- The NoiseDataset class loads these images, resizing them to 32x32 RGB tensors for training the denoiser.

2. Models:
- Classical Detection Model:
  - A YOLOv8-based object detection model (weights in best_pro.pt) is used to detect sign language letters from webcam frames.
  - The detect.py script runs inference with this model, draws bounding boxes, and buffers detected letters.

- Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Denoiser:
  - Implemented in quantum_preprocessor.py as the DenoiseQNN class.
  - Hybrid quantum-classical architecture:
    - A convolutional layer reduces input channels to 4 qubits.
    - A quantum circuit with 4 qubits applies parameterized rotations and entanglement using PennyLane.
    - The quantum circuit outputs expectation values of PauliZ operators.
    - A classical decoder network reconstructs a denoised 3x32x32 image.
  - Trained using paired noisy and clean images with MSE loss and Adam optimizer over 5 epochs (Qnn_train.py).
  - The trained model is saved as qnn_denoiser.pth.

3. Detection Pipeline:
- detect.py runs classical detection using YOLO.
- detect_q.py extends this by optionally applying the QNN denoiser on low-resolution frames before detection.
- Due to resolution constraints, detection is performed on the original frame even when denoising is enabled.

4. Post-processing:
- postprocess.py buffers detected letters to reduce noise and repeated detections.
- Applies a simple NLP correction by matching detected letter sequences to a predefined vocabulary using difflib.
- Outputs corrected words after user pauses in signing.

Summary:
The project integrates a classical YOLOv8 detection model with a quantum-classical hybrid denoising autoencoder to improve sign language letter recognition from noisy inputs. It includes data loading, model training, inference pipelines, and post-processing with NLP correction to enhance output accuracy.

This hybrid approach leverages quantum computing concepts for image denoising while maintaining robust classical detection and language correction components.
